Description of the project: The StreetVendorAPI is an API (Application Programming Interface) designed to support street vendors in managing their businesses more efficiently. It provides a platform for vendors to showcase their products, handle orders, and manage inventory. The API aims to empower street vendors by enabling them to reach a wider customer base, streamline their operations, and improve their overall business performance.

Backend development

The backend of the StreetVendorAPI is developed using Python and Django. Django is a popular web framework that makes it easy to develop and deploy web applications. The backend is responsible for storing and retrieving data, processing requests, and generating responses.

The backend is divided into three main components:

    1. The database: The database stores all of the data for the API, such as product listings, order 2. information, and inventory levels.
    2. The application logic: The application logic is responsible for processing requests from vendors and customers.
    3. The API: The API is the interface that allows vendors and customers to interact with the backend.
    The backend is hosted on a cloud server to ensure that it is always available. The server is also equipped with a firewall to protect the data from unauthorized access.


Features of the StreetVendorAPI:

Showcase products: The StreetVendorAPI allows vendors to create a digital storefront where they can showcase their products to a wider audience.
